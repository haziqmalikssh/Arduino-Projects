# Water Sensor Arduino Mega Project

## Overview
This project uses an Arduino Mega to monitor water levels or detect water presence using a water sensor. The system reads sensor data and provides real-time feedback, ideal for applications like flood detection or water tank monitoring.

## Repository Contents
- **Code**: Arduino sketch (`water_sensor.ino`) for reading and processing sensor data.
- **Schematics**: Wiring diagram (`schematics.png`) for connecting the water sensor to the Arduino Mega.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Water sensor (analog or digital)
- Jumper wires
- USB cable for programming

## Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware**:
   - Connect the water sensor to the Arduino Mega as shown in `schematics.png`.
   - Ensure proper power and ground connections.
2. **Software**:
   - Install the Arduino IDE.
   - Open `water_sensor.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega via USB.
3. **Testing**:
   - Submerge the sensor in water or simulate input to verify readings.
   - Monitor output via the Serial Monitor (9600 baud).

## Usage
- The sensor outputs analog or digital signals based on water presence/level.
- The Arduino processes the data and outputs results to the Serial Monitor.
- Modify the code to adjust thresholds or add features like alerts.

## Notes
- Ensure the sensor is compatible with 5V or 3.3V logic.
- Calibrate the sensor for accurate readings in your environment.
