# Arduino Mega Sound Sensor Project

## Overview
This project uses an Arduino Mega with a sound sensor to detect and respond to sound levels. The code and schematic are included in this repository.

## Requirements
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Sound sensor module (e.g., KY-038 or similar)
- Jumper wires
- Arduino IDE

## Setup
1. Connect the sound sensor to the Arduino Mega as shown in the provided schematic.
2. Upload the included code to the Arduino Mega using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the Arduino and sensor (typically via USB or external 5V supply).

## Code
The code (`sound_sensor.ino`) configures the Arduino Mega to:
- Read analog or digital signals from the sound sensor
- Process sound levels (e.g., trigger actions based on thresholds)
- Optional Serial Monitor output for sound data

## Schematic
The schematic (`sound_sensor_schematic.png`) illustrates the wiring between the Arduino Mega and the sound sensor module.

## Usage
- Open the code in the Arduino IDE.
- Adjust pin assignments or sound threshold values in the code as needed.
- Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
- Monitor sound detection via the Serial Monitor (if enabled).

## Notes
- Ensure the sound sensor is compatible with the Arduino Mega’s 5V logic.
- Calibrate the sensor’s sensitivity (if adjustable) for your environment.
- Test in a controlled setting to verify sound detection accuracy.
