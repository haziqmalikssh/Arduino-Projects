# Arduino Mega Remote Motor Control Project

## Overview
This project uses an Arduino Mega to remotely control a motor (e.g., DC or stepper) via a wireless module. The code and schematic are included in this repository.

## Requirements
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Motor (DC or stepper) and compatible driver (e.g., L298N for DC, A4988 for stepper)
- Wireless module (e.g., HC-05 Bluetooth, NRF24L01, or ESP8266 WiFi)
- Jumper wires
- External power supply for the motor
- Arduino IDE

## Setup
1. Connect the motor, driver, and wireless module to the Arduino Mega as shown in the provided schematic.
2. Upload the included code to the Arduino Mega using the Arduino IDE.
3. Ensure the motor and driver are powered by an appropriate external power supply.

## Code
The code (`remote_motor_control.ino`) configures the Arduino Mega to:
- Receive commands via the wireless module
- Control motor speed, direction, or steps (based on motor type)
- Optional feedback via Serial Monitor

## Schematic
The schematic (`remote_motor_schematic.png`) illustrates the wiring between the Arduino Mega, motor driver, motor, and wireless module.

## Usage
- Open the code in the Arduino IDE.
- Adjust pin assignments, motor parameters, or wireless settings in the code as needed.
- Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
- Use a paired device (e.g., smartphone, PC, or another Arduino) to send remote commands.
- Monitor operation via the Serial Monitor (if enabled).

## Notes
- Ensure the wireless module is properly paired/configured before use.
- Verify the motor driverâ€™s compatibility with the motor and power supply.
- Test in a safe environment to avoid electrical or mechanical hazards.
