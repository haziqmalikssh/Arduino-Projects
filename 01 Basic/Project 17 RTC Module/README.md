# Arduino Mega RTC Module Project

This project demonstrates the use of a **Real-Time Clock (RTC) module** with an **Arduino Mega**. It provides accurate timekeeping, allowing your Arduino projects to track date and time even when powered off.

## Features

- Display current time and date.
- Set and update RTC module time.
- Simple integration with Arduino Mega.


## Hardware Required

- Arduino Mega 2560
- RTC module (DS1307 / DS3231 recommended)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Software

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Install the required library (if not already installed):
   - `RTClib` (for DS1307/DS3231)
3. Load the example sketch from the repository.
4. Upload to the Arduino Mega.
5. Open the Serial Monitor to view the time and date.

## Usage

- The example sketch reads the time from the RTC module and prints it to the Serial Monitor every second.
- Modify the code to integrate time-based functionality into your own projects, such as alarms, timers, or data logging.

## Notes

- Ensure the RTC module has a battery installed to keep track of time when the Arduino is powered off.
- DS3231 modules are recommended for higher accuracy.
- Double-check your connections before powering on to prevent damage.
