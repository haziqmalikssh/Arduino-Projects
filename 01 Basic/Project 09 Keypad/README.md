# Arduino Mega Keypad Project

## Overview
This project interfaces a keypad (e.g., 4x4 or 4x3 membrane keypad) with an Arduino Mega 2560 to capture user input. The keypad can be used for various applications, such as entering passwords, controlling devices, or navigating menus. The input is processed by the Arduino and can be displayed via the Serial Monitor or used to trigger specific actions.

This repository contains the Arduino code and a schematic for connecting the keypad to the Arduino Mega.

## Features
- Captures input from a keypad connected to the Arduino Mega.
- Outputs key presses to the Serial Monitor.
- Configurable for custom key mappings or actions.
- Compatible with the Arduino Mega 2560.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Keypad (e.g., 4x4 or 4x3 membrane keypad)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional for prototyping)
- USB cable for Arduino programming and power

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (version 1.8.19 or later recommended)
- Keypad library for Arduino (ensure it is installed via `Tools > Manage Libraries`)
- Serial Monitor for viewing keypad input

## Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the keypad to the Arduino Mega as shown in the schematic provided in this repository.
   - Ensure proper connections for the row and column pins of the keypad.
   - Verify wiring to prevent incorrect key detection.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Download and install the Arduino IDE from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Install the Keypad library via `Tools > Manage Libraries` in the Arduino IDE (search for "Keypad" by Mark Stanley and Alexander Brevig).
   - Clone or download this repository to your computer.
   - Open the `.ino` file (located in the repository) in the Arduino IDE.

3. **Uploading the Code**:
   - Connect your Arduino Mega to your computer via a USB cable.
   - In the Arduino IDE, select `Tools > Board > Arduino Mega or Mega 2560`.
   - Select the correct port under `Tools > Port`.
   - Click the "Upload" button to upload the code to the Arduino.

4. **Testing**:
   - Open the Serial Monitor (`Tools > Serial Monitor`) in the Arduino IDE.
   - Set the baud rate to match the value specified in the code (default is typically 9600).
   - Press keys on the keypad and observe the corresponding output in the Serial Monitor.

## Usage
- After uploading the code, the Arduino will detect key presses on the keypad.
- Key presses are printed to the Serial Monitor as characters or symbols defined in the code.
- Modify the code (e.g., keymap, pin assignments, or actions) to suit your project requirements.
- Refer to the schematic for correct pin connections if adapting the project to other setups.

## Troubleshooting
- **No output in Serial Monitor**: Ensure the correct baud rate is set and the USB cable is properly connected.
- **Incorrect key detection**: Check keypad wiring, especially row and column pin connections, and confirm the keymap in the code matches your keypad layout.
- **Library issues**: Verify that the Keypad library is installed and up to date.
- **Keypad not responding**: Ensure all connections are secure and the keypad is functional.
