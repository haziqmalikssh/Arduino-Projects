## Overview
This project enables an Arduino Mega to receive and decode IR signals using an IR receiver module. It can be used to control devices or trigger actions based on signals from an IR remote.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Mega 2560
- IR receiver module (e.g., TSOP1738 or equivalent)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional for prototyping)

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the IR receiver module to the Arduino Mega as shown in the schematic.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to the Mega using the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view the decoded IR signals.
4. Point an IR remote at the receiver and press buttons to test.

## Code Explanation
The code in the repository uses an IR library to decode signals. It:
- Initializes the IR receiver on a specified pin.
- Listens for incoming IR signals.
- Outputs the decoded values to the Serial Monitor.

Refer to the code comments for detailed functionality.

## Schematic
The schematic in the repository illustrates the connections:
- IR receiver OUT pin to a digital pin on the Arduino Mega.
- VCC to 5V and GND to GND.

## Usage
- After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor (9600 baud) to see the decoded IR signals.
- Press buttons on your IR remote to send signals to the receiver.
- Use the decoded values to trigger actions in your project.
