# Arduino LED Control Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple LED control circuit using an Arduino microcontroller. The setup includes an Arduino board connected to multiple LEDs through resistors, allowing for basic digital output control.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- LEDs (3 or more)
- 220Î© Resistors (one per LED)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable for Arduino

## Circuit Diagram
The circuit is shown above.

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (latest version recommended)

## Installation
1. Connect the hardware as per the circuit diagram.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the provided sketch (`led_control.ino`) to the Arduino board.
4. Ensure the correct board and port are selected in the IDE.

## Usage
- Upon uploading the sketch, the LEDs will blink in a sequence.
- Modify the code to adjust the blinking pattern or add more complex behaviors as needed.

## Code
The accompanying `led_control.ino` file contains the Arduino sketch to control the LEDs. Ensure it is placed in the same directory as this README for proper project structure.
