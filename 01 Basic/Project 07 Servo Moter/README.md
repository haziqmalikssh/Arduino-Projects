Arduino Mega Servo Motor Project
Overview
This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using an Arduino Mega. The repository includes the Arduino code and a schematic for setting up the hardware. The project is designed for hobbyists, students, or anyone interested in learning about servo motor control with Arduino.
Features

Control one or more servo motors with precise angle positioning.
Compatible with the Arduino Mega 2560.
Includes example code for basic servo movement.
Accompanied by a schematic for proper hardware connections.

Prerequisites

Hardware:
Arduino Mega 2560
Servo motor(s) (e.g., SG90 or similar)
Jumper wires
(Optional) External power supply for the servo (if required)


Software:
Arduino IDE (version 1.8.x or later)
Servo library (included in the Arduino IDE by default)



Installation

Clone the Repository:git clone <repository-url>


Open the Arduino Code:
Navigate to the repository folder.
Open the .ino file (e.g., servo_control.ino) in the Arduino IDE.


Connect the Hardware:
Refer to the schematic in the repository (e.g., schematic.png or schematic.pdf) to connect the servo motor to the Arduino Mega.
Ensure proper wiring for power, ground, and signal lines.
Note: If using an external power supply for the servo, ensure the ground is shared with the Arduino.


Upload the Code:
Connect your Arduino Mega to your computer via USB.
In the Arduino IDE, select Tools > Board > Arduino Mega or Mega 2560.
Upload the code to the Arduino.



Usage

Once the code is uploaded, the servo motor should move according to the programmed instructions.
Modify the code (e.g., adjust angles or timing) in the .ino file to customize the servo's behavior.
Monitor the serial output (if enabled in the code) in the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor (Tools > Serial Monitor) at the specified baud rate for debugging or status updates.

Repository Structure

/servo_control.ino: The main Arduino sketch for controlling the servo motor.
/schematic.<extension>: The schematic file showing the hardware connections (e.g., .png, .pdf).
/README.md: This file, providing project documentation.

Notes

Ensure the servo motor is compatible with the Arduino Mega's 5V signal and power requirements.
If the servo requires more current than the Arduino can provide, use an external power source with a common ground.
Test the servo with small angle changes initially to avoid damaging the motor or connected components.
