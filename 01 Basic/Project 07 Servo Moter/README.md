# Arduino Mega Servo Motor Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using an Arduino Mega. The repository includes the Arduino code and a schematic for setting up the hardware. It is designed for hobbyists, students, or anyone interested in learning about servo motor control with Arduino.

## Features
- Control a servo motors with precise angle positioning.
- Compatible with the Arduino Mega 2560.
- Includes example code for basic servo movement.
- Accompanied by a schematic for proper hardware connections.

## Prerequisites
### Hardware
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Servo motor(s) (e.g., SG90 or similar)
- Jumper wires
- External power supply for the servo of 5 volts

### Software
- Arduino IDE (version 1.8.x or later)
- Servo library (included in the Arduino IDE by default)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Open the Arduino Code**:
   - Navigate to the repository folder.
   - Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. **Connect the Hardware**:
   - Refer to the schematic in the repository to connect the servo motor to the Arduino Mega.
   - Ensure proper wiring for power, ground, and signal lines.
   - **Note**: If using an external power supply for the servo, ensure the ground is shared with the Arduino.
4. **Upload the Code**:
   - Connect your Arduino Mega to your computer via USB.
   - In the Arduino IDE, select `Tools > Board > Arduino Mega or Mega 2560`.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino.

## Usage
- After uploading the code, the servo motor will move according to the programmed instructions.
- Modify the code (e.g., adjust angles or timing) in the `.ino` file to customize the servo's behavior.
- Monitor the serial output (if enabled in the code) in the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor (`Tools > Serial Monitor`) at the specified baud rate for debugging or status updates.

## Notes
- Ensure the servo motor is compatible with the Arduino Mega's 5V signal and power requirements.
- If the servo requires more current than the Arduino can provide, use an external power source with a common ground.
- Test the servo with small angle changes initially to avoid damaging the motor or connected components.
