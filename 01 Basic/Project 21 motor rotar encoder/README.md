# Arduino Mega Motor with Rotary Encoder Project

## Overview
This project uses an Arduino Mega to control a motor (e.g., DC or stepper) with a rotary encoder for precise position or speed feedback. The code and schematic are included in this repository.

## Requirements
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Motor (DC or stepper) and compatible driver (e.g., L298N for DC, A4988 for stepper)
- Rotary encoder (e.g., KY-040 or similar)
- Jumper wires
- External power supply for the motor
- Arduino IDE

## Setup
1. Connect the motor, driver, and rotary encoder to the Arduino Mega as shown in the provided schematic.
2. Upload the included code to the Arduino Mega using the Arduino IDE.
3. Ensure the motor and driver are powered by an appropriate external power supply.

## Code
The code (`motor_encoder_control.ino`) configures the Arduino Mega to:
- Control motor speed or position based on encoder feedback
- Read rotary encoder signals for position or speed monitoring
- Optional Serial Monitor output for encoder data

## Schematic
The schematic (`motor_encoder_schematic.png`) illustrates the wiring between the Arduino Mega, motor driver, motor, and rotary encoder.

## Usage
- Open the code in the Arduino IDE.
- Adjust pin assignments, motor parameters, or encoder resolution in the code as needed.
- Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
- Monitor motor and encoder operation via the Serial Monitor (if enabled).

## Notes
- Ensure the rotary encoder is properly connected to interrupt-capable pins if required.
- Verify the motor driverâ€™s compatibility with the motor and power supply.
- Test in a safe environment to avoid electrical or mechanical issues.
