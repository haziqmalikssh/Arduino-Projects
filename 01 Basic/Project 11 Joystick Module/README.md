# Arduino Mega Joystick Module Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a joystick module with an Arduino Mega. The joystick module allows for analog input in two axes (X and Y) and a digital input for a pushbutton. The repository contains all necessary code and schematics to set up and run the project.

## Features
- Reads X and Y axis values from the joystick module.
- Detects pushbutton presses.
- Compatible with Arduino Mega.
- Example code for processing joystick input and outputting data (e.g., via Serial Monitor).

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Joystick module (with X, Y, and button outputs)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
- USB cable for programming the Arduino

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (version 1.8.19 or later recommended)
- No external libraries required

## Setup Instructions
1. **Connect the Joystick Module**:
   - Refer to the schematics in the repository (`/schematics`) for wiring details.
   - Typically, connect:
     - VCC to Arduino 5V
     - GND to Arduino GND
     - VRX (X-axis) to an analog pin (e.g., A0)
     - VRY (Y-axis) to an analog pin (e.g., A1)
     - SW (button) to a digital pin (e.g., D2)

2. **Upload the Code**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Load the main sketch from the `/code` directory.
   - Connect your Arduino Mega to your computer via USB.
   - Upload the sketch to the Arduino.

3. **Test the Setup**:
   - Open the Serial Monitor (set to 9600 baud) to view joystick output.
   - Move the joystick and press the button to verify readings.

## Repository Contents
- `/code`: Contains the Arduino sketch (`.ino` file) for reading joystick inputs.
- `/schematics`: Includes wiring diagrams for connecting the joystick module to the Arduino Mega.

## Usage
- The code reads analog values from the joystick's X and Y axes (0â€“1023) and the digital state of the pushbutton (HIGH/LOW).
- Output is sent to the Serial Monitor for debugging or can be modified for other applications (e.g., controlling motors, LEDs, or a game interface).
- Customize the code in `/code` to map joystick values to your specific use case.

## Troubleshooting
- **No Serial Output**: Ensure the correct baud rate (9600) is set in the Serial Monitor and that the Arduino is properly connected.
- **Erratic Readings**: Check wiring connections and ensure the joystick module is powered correctly (5V).
- **Button Not Working**: Verify the button pin is correctly configured in the code and connected to the right digital pin.
